const BIO = `
Hi, I’m Yousuf! I'm a web developer with in-depth experience in
            front-end programming languages. In a nutshell, I create websites
            that help organizations address business challenges and meet their
            needs. I manage everything from website navigation and layout to a
            company's web hosting and security architecture. My expertise lies
            within front-end web apps, and the main languages in my tech stack
            are JavaScript, React, and of course HTML/CSS. I’m a lifelong
            learner (currently taking a course on building Mobile applications
            with React Native!) and love to read, run, and find new friends in
            Herat City.
